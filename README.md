# Surat_House_Price_Prediction

The creation of a housing price prediction model can help a home seller or a real estate agent make more educated choices based on the estimation of house prices. Several studies have documented the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms to forecast property values. We have used different alternative machine learning (ML) architectures, based on Random Forest (RF) Decision tree, Linear regression and Svm , to predict the pricing of properties. 

## Introduction: 

    Together with other fundamental necessities like food, water, and many other things, a place to call home is one of a person's most basic wants. The demand for homes increased quickly over time as people's living standards rose. Although some people buy homes as investments or as real estate, the majority of people purchase homes for habitation or as a means of support.
    Every year, there is an increase in demand for homes, which indirectly leads to price increases for homes. The issue arises when there are numerous factors, such as location and property demand, that could affect the price of a home. As a result, the majority of stakeholdersâ€”buyers,sellers, builders, and the real estate industryâ€”would like to know the precise attributes or factors influencing the price of a home in making decisions .
    The house-price model offers numerous advantages to homebuyers, property investors, and builders. The valuation of house prices in the current market, which will assist them in determining house prices, will be provided by this model to home buyers, property investors, and house builders. In the meantime, this model can assist potential buyers in selecting the features of a house that best suit their needs and budget.

## Model Implemented: 
    > Linear Regression
    > SVM Algorithm
    > Random Forest Algorithm
    > Decision Tree Algorithm
   
## Uniqueness:  
    The dataset was generated through research where the dataset was not available online. Several algorithms were utilized to facilitate user selection for prediction, and various parameters/features were factored in for accuracy. Additionally, a GUI was developed to further aid the user. The project was tailored to specifically cater to the unique characteristics of Surat City.

## Conclusion :
    ML algorithms enable the prediction of house prices for Surat City. Multiple algorithms were employed for this task, with SVM proving to be the most accurate. By leveraging the concepts of deep learning and neural networks, the accuracy can be further enhanced beyond that of basic ML algorithms.
